# Tangible Multi-Display Toolkit

Purpose of project. And link to conference.

There are 3 main components of project:
- View: Top down
- View: First person view
- Participant controller

## Installation

### Views

Steps to get the app on 3 iPads
- Clone this repo

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/ryanntt/tangible-multi-display-toolkit.git
```

- Initialize the Unity project

As we all used standard packages for Unity, once you import the project, the initialization will download required assets from Unity Store. The assets not available on Unity Store are kept to small sizes in the repository.

Watch out for Unity version. We tested this on version and it was working. We were using Xcode 12 in April 2019. You might need to spend more time fixing the toolkit on the newer version of Unity and Xcode. It is better that you select the Unity version that support the Xcode version.

- Configure the IP address of controller.

In this repository for Camera view, we are using [Photon Realtime](https://www.photonengine.com/en-US/Realtime) to sync the position of care between all devices. This project is currently using my project's quota and it is limited to 20 players at the same time. Please feel free to use it or setup your own for more quota.

As the controller iPad needs to have fixed IP to communicate with the view iPads, we will need to have our own local network. We used [device_name](#) in our study but any other device should do the job.

In `Assets/Scripts/UDPReceive.cs` line 27:
```
    public string IP = "192.168.0.107";
```

Use your own IP number here



- Deploy the project to iPad


### Controller

- Clonse the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/HoggenMari/AVLightingToolkit.git
```

## Setup and running

How to setup 3 iPads

## Configure the toolkit

### LED Colours
We use HEX value to display the color. This might be difficult for lighting designer to manipulate the colors. You will need a converter to get HEX from HSL or RGB. There are many web tools available online for this. We used [ColorSlurp](https://colorslurp.com/), an free Mac app.


To change colour of LED in Script, run public function ```ChangeColor()``` using following syntax:
```ChangeColor(string[] string )```

For example:

```ChangeColor(new string[] { "#00FF00", "#FF0000", "#0000FF", "#00FF00", "#FF0000", "#0000FF" });```

The function will change colours of all 21 LEDs. If the number of colours is less than 21, then random colours will be assigned. This function is declared in file ```Scripts/LEDControl.cs```.

### Context

To change the text of any indicator, target ``Context Manager script`` in ``object Context Manager`` and run public function:
`UpdateContext(int i, string text)` to update the text of context **i**th. **i** ranges from 1 to 4.
